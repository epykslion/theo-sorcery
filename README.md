# Welcome! You're probably wondering what this is

This is a GitHub repository. It's where code is kept safely, where developers can travel back in time to check if they encounter any bugs, while collaborating asynchronously.

As an open source project, like most others, other passionate developers can contribute to the code-base to suggest improvements and build upon an existing software or even the technology used to build them.

This website was built on TailwindCSS for styling, and Sveltekit for it's markup and Javascript logic.

Personally, I'm a bit spoilt by component-based frameworks as they allow us to reuse parts of code to keep it <span title="Don't Repeat Yourself">**DRY**</span>.

By the way, since this file was written in Markdown, it's practically a beginner-friendly way to code, as it's a superset of <span title="HyperText Markup Language">**HTML**</span>, the language that determines the structure of any website or application. If you hover over the bolded text, you'll see a tool-tip that shows what these abbreviations mean.

Go ahead, give it a try! Enjoy your time on the inter-webs!
